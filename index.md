### Questions
1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
  - I think the most interesting topic covered in my domain so far is the usage of multi-layer virtual nodes to aggregate information while capturing long-range message passing.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
  - One potential investigation that I would like to pursue is integrating detailed placement information (using coordinates of the cell/instance) to improve prediction of congestion.
3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
  - Instead of a fixed number of hierarchy levels, perhaps adjusting the depth based on the size and complexity of the netlist is an approach that can be used.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using your project?
  - I think most of the techniques would be similar to what the paper has already implemented but the change in aggregations or changing the metrics when testing my model is something to look forward to.
